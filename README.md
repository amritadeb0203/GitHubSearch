# GitHubSearch

Create a .Net Framework/Core web application that utilises GitHub APIs to allow a user to
search for a repository by name. The application should also offer a detail view for viewing
more information about a repository. This detail view should include the repository’s
readme, if available, and the number of open issues, number of forks, etc.

/Search results

/ Repo detail page

Requirements:

● The application must be a .Net Framework/Core MVC solution.

● Use Dependency Injection where possible

● You may use a CSS framework (e.g. Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.) to provide the base
styles for your application.

● Your codebase should include a .gitignore file that excludes third-party code you’re
using but didn’t write yourself
